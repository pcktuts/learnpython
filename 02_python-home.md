# Python Introduction
## What is Python?
Python is a dynamically typed intrepreted programming language
created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

We can use Python for:

* web development (server-side).
* desktop software development.
* data science and scientific computing.
* to write scripts.

## Some features of Python compared to other languages
* Python was designed as a beginner friendly language, syntax of 
the language is very close to English language.
* Python uses new lines to end a statements, other languages uses
`;` for that
* Python uses indendation using whitespace to define scope instead of 
`{ }` which are used in many other programming languages.

In Javascript
```js
function greet() {
    return "Hello world!";
}
```
In Python
```python
def greet():
    return "Hello world" # Note there is no semicolon needed here.
```
This will not work
```python
def greet():
return "Hello world"
```
