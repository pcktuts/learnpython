## To run and test short codes you can use Python's inbuilt command line, type the below command in yout command prompt 
This is called `REPL`, Read Evaluate Print Loop. You can type a valid python command and after pressing enter it will be executed. If it is 
a block of code it will be executed once block is completed.
```bash
