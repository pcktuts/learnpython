## How can we avoid writing unecessary comments by meaningful code?
Bad practice
{: .label .label-red }
```python
x = "Kochi" # This is place
u = "Searching for a Job" # This is employment status
```
Replace the above comments with meaningful code.

Good practice
{: .label .label-green }
```python
place = "Kochi" 
employment_status = "Searching for a Job"
```
In the above code we do not need to add comments as the code is self explanatory.
