# Files
File handling is important in any business applications. Python provides inbuilt functions which we can use to create, read, modify and delete files.

We have different modes while we open a file as listed below.

| mode        | description        
|:-------------|:------------------|
| r           | Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist 
| a | Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist  | 
| w           | Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist      |
| x           | Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists |
