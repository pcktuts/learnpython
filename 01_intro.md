# Introduction
## What can you do with a programming language?

* Perform calculations with very large numbers in seconds.
* Read/Create/Write/Delete files in a system.
* Recieve or send data to a remote computer over network.
* Store the results as files or in a database such as MySQL.

## What kind of calculations?
* operations that are built into the language.
* operations that we as a programmer define.

### *computers can only do what you tell them to do.*

## Types of knwoledge
* Declarative knwoledge - Statements of fact
    * You can learn Python for free from our online class.
* Imperative knowledge - How to do it
    * Join for the class
    * Attend the class regularly
    * Practice the topics and problems.
    * You will learn Python.

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

### Sample algorithm for adding two numbers
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum. 
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum‚Üênum1+num2 
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop
