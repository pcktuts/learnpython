# Nested loops

In python we can have one loop inside another loop. Such kinds of loops are called nested loops.

### Example: printing multiplication table with nested for loops

# Infinite loops

A loop which runs forever are called `inifinite` loops. It will make our system crash as the program never finishes. We must be very careful while dealing with loops so that we can avoid this situation.

warning, it might crash your system
