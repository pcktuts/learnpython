# Inheritance 
Inheritance allows us to create a class which can inherits all the methods and properties of another class. Thus it enables code reusability. 

* Parent Class - Class from which another class is inheriting
* Child Class - Class which inherits from the Parent class, it is also called derived class.

</div>

## Using `__init__` in the child class

We can pass params to the parent class constructor also we can use any extra arguments which we need in the child class as well. In this way we can extend the child class by using parent class features and adding it's own unique features as well.
