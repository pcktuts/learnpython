# Types of Errors

1. Syntax Error
2. Runtime Error
3. Semantic Error

## Syntax Error
Syntax is rules of the programming lanugage such as which character are valid and which characters are not, Like the grammar in the English.

* If there is any syntax error the code is not going to run

In the below example we are missing the closing `"` double quotes which will throw the syntax error.

## Run Time error
* If there is a run time error some part of the code may give an output

## Semantic Error
* This can be the most difficult to fix. There won't be any error actually. But it might not be what the programmer intended.

## In general what can happen if things goes wrong
1. Program crashes, stops running
2. Program runs forever such as infinite loop.
3. Program gives an answer but different than expected

**Think about the syntax and semantics carefully while you write a program, Then only you will get the output what you intended**
