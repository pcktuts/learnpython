# Data Types
Consider the following example
```python
age = 20 # data type is integer
name = "Muhammed" # data type is string
score = 95.6 # data type is floating point number
```
Data type means the type of the value that a variable holds. In the above example variable `age` has a value of `20` and the data type of `age` is `integer`. The data type is automatically set when you declare a variable. We can set the data type as well.

Below listed are the data types in Python. Makred in **bold** are the ones that we use most of the time. We will learn about the important data types in upcoming session.

| Category     | Data type

| Text Type    | **str** 
| Numeric Types| **int, float**, complex 
| Boolean Type | **bool**    
| Sequence Types | **list, tuple, range**
| Mapping Type | **dict**
| Set Types    | set, frozenset

To know the type of a variable you can use python's inbuilt function like this.
